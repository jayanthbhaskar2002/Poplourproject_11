# *LANGUAGE EVOLUTION*

- The language that is designed by our team evolved by using the given book  “Kernighan Ritchie THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.”
- On reading each chapter and each concept in the book we always thought to make them user friendly and easier than C.
- We tried to keep the syntax of our language easily understandable and in a creative way than C.
- As in C we didn't take multiple datatypes for each type based on the memory it occupies like *int, long int; float, double* in this language we took only a single datatype for how large or small the type is.
- Some things that we find difficult or irritated to use them either in fuctions or the methods done to them in C are made easier in our language.

  > ### Example:
    >- In C we have ***arrays*** having a collection of only single datatype and we cannot add or delete particular element in it which makes us to write a function for it seperately.
    >- Whereas in our language we have ***lists*** which can have a collection of different datatypes(but cannot have another list in it.) and the above operations can easily be done with simple instructions. 
- We thought of many different ideas but for some ideas there are consequences that made us hit the dead end.     
- In this manner the evolution our language happend.
